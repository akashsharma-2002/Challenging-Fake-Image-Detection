## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a fake image detection system that achieves high accuracy and robustness. The system should be capable of differentiating between real and AI-generated images, helping to identify potentially deceptive visual content.
## Expected Outcome

We expect the following outcomes from this project:

1: Achieve a model with high accuracy in distinguishing between real and AI-generated images.

2: Ensure the model's robustness, making it effective in detecting fake images across various scenarios.

3: A well-documented fake image detection system.

## Project Overview

Fake Image Detection Algorithm: Describe the algorithm or model used for fake image detection.

Data Preprocessing: Explain any data preprocessing steps, including image resizing, normalization, or augmentation.

Training: Detail how the model was trained, including the choice of hyperparameters and optimization techniques.

Evaluation: Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

Results: Summarize the results achieved, including accuracy, precision, recall, and any visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project has been sourced from Kaggle. It contains real and fake face images for use in face detection tasks. You can access the dataset on Kaggle using the following link:

Please make sure to follow the dataset's terms of use and citation requirements as specified on the Kaggle dataset page.

## How to run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Access the Kaggle environment using the provided [Real and Fake Face Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection/code).

2. Create a new Kaggle notebook or upload the project files to your Kaggle workspace.

3. Open the notebook and execute the code cells to perform fake image detection on the dataset.

## Result

In this section, we present the results of our fake image detection system by comparing actual and predicted images. Below are visualizations of some sample images:

1. **Sample Images with Predicted Labels:**

Here, we display a selection of sample images alongside their predicted labels. The images are shown in pairs, with the actual image on the left and the predicted image (with labels) on the right.
